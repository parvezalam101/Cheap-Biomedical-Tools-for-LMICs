This project aims to develop open source platforms for all things related to the design and engineering of cheap biomedical products, tools, equipment and devices that can be manufactured and made in low-to-medium income countries. Many low-to-medium income countries have a disease burden and healthcare systems in such countries could be improved by increasing knowledge and skills in biomedical engineering such that biomedical products/tools etc can be built locally. This will in time (we hope) circumvent equipment shortages that result from the extortionately high costs of biomedical equipment imported from higher income countries. 

This archive welcomes contributions in the following areas:

- Information guides, case studies, and video examples on both specific and general biomedical devices that can be built easily, safely and at low-cost
- Information guides, case studies, and video examples on the safe use and application of such biomedical tools/devices
- Open access articles, case studies, videos etc related to biomedical engineering from both R&D and education/teaching perspectives

Anything else that could be useful!
